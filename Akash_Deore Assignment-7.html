    <p><mark> Q7. Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs.
            You could name this new file another_page.html, and you should place it into
            the same folder where your first .html is. After you have created the new .html
            page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load another_page.html
            when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use
            the a and a tags in this exercise. Inside the tag a you need to use a
            href attribute that specifies which page will be loaded when the link is clicked</mark></p>

    <h1>Full Stack Development</h1>
    <p>Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development, including the front end and back end.
         The front end consists of the user interface, and the back end takes care of the business logic and application workflows</p>
    <p>Full stack developers must have knowledge of an entire technology stack, i.e., the set of technologies that are used to build an end-to-end application quickly and efficiently. For example, if they want to build an application using the MEAN stack, they should know how to work with MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.
       Full stack developers should be able to judge whether the selected technologies are the right choice for their project during the early phases. Some responsibilities of a full stack developer are to
        Help in choosing the right technologies for the project development and testing both on the front end and the back end.
        Write clean code across the stack by following the best practices of the tools used.
        Be up to date with the latest technologies and tools to make the best technology usage decisions</p>
